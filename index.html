      <h4><a href="crypto/crypto.html">EXPath Cryptographic Module</a></h4>
      <h5>
         This proposal defines a module for providing cryptographic services,
         which consists of a set of XPath 2.0 extension functions related to XML Digital Signature,
         encryption and decryption, and
         checking of integrity and authentication of data. It has been designed to be compatible
         with XQuery 1.0
         and XSLT 2.0, as well as any other standard based on XPath 2.0.

      <h4><a href="datatype-conversion/datatype-conversion.html">EXPath DataType Conversion Module</a></h4>
      <h5>
         This proposal defines a module for providing conversions between various XPath Data
         Model datatypes.
         It has been designed to be compatible with XQuery 3.0 and XSLT 3.0, as well as any
         other standard based on XPath 3.0.

      <h5>
         This proposal provides a Digital Publishing module for XPath 2.0.
         		It defines extension functions for converting from one digital format to another,
         to
         		execute various processing operations of digital documents, etc.
         		It has been designed to be compatible with XQuery 1.0 and XSLT 2.0, as well as any
         other standard based on XPath 2.0.

      <h4><a href="ft-client/ft-client.html">EXPath File Transfer Client Module</a></h4>
      <h5>
         This proposal provides a File Transfer Client interface for XPath 3.0. It defines
         functions covering the operations needed to
         manage (remote) resources (files and directories). It has been designed to be compatible
         with XQuery 3.0 and XSLT 3.0, as well as any other standard based on XPath 3.0.
