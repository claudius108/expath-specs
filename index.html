      <h4><a href="crypto/crypto.html">EXPath Cryptographic Module</a></h4>
      <h5>
         This proposal defines a module for providing cryptographic services,
         which consists of a set of XPath 2.0 extension functions related to XML Digital Signature,
         encryption and decryption, and
         checking of integrity and authentication of data. It has been designed to be compatible
         with XQuery 1.0
         and XSLT 2.0, as well as any other standard based on XPath 2.0.
         
      </h5>
