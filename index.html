      <h4><a href="crypto/crypto.html">EXPath Cryptographic Module</a></h4>
      <h5>
         This proposal defines a module for providing cryptographic services,
         which consists of a set of XPath 2.0 extension functions related to XML Digital Signature,
         encryption and decryption, and
         checking of integrity and authentication of data. It has been designed to be compatible
         with XQuery 1.0
         and XSLT 2.0, as well as any other standard based on XPath 2.0.
         
      </h5>
      <h4><a href="datatype-conversion/datatype-conversion.html">EXPath DataType Conversion Module</a></h4>
      <h5>
         This proposal defines a module for providing conversions between various XPath Data
         Model datatypes.
         It has been designed to be compatible with XQuery 3.0 and XSLT 3.0, as well as any
         other standard based on XPath 3.0.
